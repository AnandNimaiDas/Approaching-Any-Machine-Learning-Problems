## What is t-SNE

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to represent high-dimensional dataset in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions so that we can visualize it. In contrast to other dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA which simply maximizes the variance, t-SNE creates a reduced feature space where similar samples are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar samples are modeled by distant points with high probability.


## What is done in Jupyter Notebook
Converting the MNIST dataset which is a popular supervised handwritten digit dataset to an unsupervised setting using basic visualization(t-SNE)

### MNIST Dataset:
